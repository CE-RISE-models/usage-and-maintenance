abstract: >-
  Repository for the CE-RISE Usage and Maintenance data model that captures the operational lifecycle of products through a mixed temporal approach: static reference information (instructions, schedules), accumulating state-based metrics (usage hours, performance), and discrete event-based records (maintenance, repairs). It enables comprehensive tracking of how products are used, maintained, and serviced throughout their operational life.
